# goMarkov
Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulator

Simple MCMC program written from scratch for my own interest. I wrote it to compliment my theroetical study of Classical Stochastic Systems. I was very intertested in the the Non-Equilibrium dynamics of Eco-Evo Systems. I wanted to apply the Doi-Peliti Method to study them, and have a numerical backstop to support my understanding.

The package worked pretty well but had a lot of bottlenecks implenting channels on Windows when I first wrote it. I have no clue if these still exist in the current version of Go (I also run arch now)

Finally going to clean it up and add the visuals hopefully!
